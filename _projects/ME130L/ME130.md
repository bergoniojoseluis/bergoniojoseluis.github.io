title: Computer Applications for Mechnical Engineers - Fusion 360 Design & Simulation Projects
description: Developed multiple mechanical joint designs — including knuckle, cotter, and turnbuckle joints — using Fusion 360 for 3D modeling, assembly, and static stress analysis. Projects required independent engineering calculations, material selection, and performance validation, strengthening my skills in turning design requirements into manufacturable CAD models and professional technical documentation.

## #1 - Knuckle Joint – Fusion 360 Design
<span style="font-size: 10px">Designed and modeled a knuckle joint in Fusion 360 to withstand a 50 kN axial tensile force, calculating all dimensions from given load conditions and potential failure modes. Selected materials, assembled components, and validated performance through static stress simulation, demonstrating end-to-end mechanical design capability with minimal guidance.

## #2 - Knuckle Joint – Static Stress Analysis
<span style="font-size: 10px">The phase involved performing a static stress analysis to validate my theoretical calculations. The simulation results, which included an analysis of 1st and 3rd principal stresses, displacements, reaction forces, strain, contact pressure, and contact forces, confirmed that the maximum stress generated was only 65.84 MPa, well below the material's permissible stress limit of 170 MPa. This robust design was proven to be secure and suitable for its intended application, demonstrating a complete and successful end-to-end mechanical design workflow.

## #3 - Cotter Joint
<span style="font-size: 10px">Designed a cotter joint in Fusion 360 to connect two co-axial rods under a specified axial load, beginning with material selection and safety factor determination. Calculated precise dimensions considering potential failure modes in tension, shear, and crushing for the spigot, socket, and cotter. Developed accurate 3D models, assembled the joint, and performed static stress analysis to confirm that the design met all structural and performance requirements.

## #4 - Turnbuckle Joint
<span style="font-size: 10px">Designed a turnbuckle joint in Fusion 360, determining dimensions from load requirements and failure considerations, and created a precise 3D assembly of all components.
