title: Computer-Aided Drafting and Designs (AutoCAD Projects)
description: As part of my college coursework in Computer-Aided Drafting and Design, I developed a series of technical drawings using AutoCAD to simulate real-world engineering documentation. This project introduced me to the fundamentals of CAD, including the **AutoCAD** interface, essential commands, and precise drafting techniques. I translated conceptual designs into accurate 2D drawings, ensuring proper scaling, dimensioning, and adherence to industry standards. Through this experience, I learned to interpret engineering drawings, optimize workflows within the AutoCAD environment, and apply meticulous attention to detail — key skills for producing professional, manufacturable designs.
skills: 
- AutoCAD 2D Drafting 
- Technical Documentation & Annotation
- Attention-to-Detail
- 3D Modeling & Visualization
- Engineering Drawing Standards (ISO/ASME)

## #1 - Lines & Circles
<span style="font-size: 10px">"This features six different geometric patterns created using a combination of straight lines, circles, and curves. The designs range from a simple yin-yang symbol to more complex interlocking rings and a hexagonal pattern with three-dimensional blocks. This plate demonstrates an understanding of **fundamental CAD drawing tools** for creating precise 2D shapes and patterns.</span>

## #2 - Layers and Properties of Screw Threads
<span style="font-size: 10px">"This showcases detailed orthographic projections of a hexagon head bolt and a square head bolt. The drawings include various views—top, side, and rotated—to illustrate the screw threads, chamfers, and overall dimensions. The title suggests the drawing's purpose is to demonstrate the use of different **layers and properties** in a CAD program to represent distinct features of a mechanical component.</span>

## #3 - Industrial Plant Floor Plan Layout
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Titled "This showcases a top-down view of a facility with various sections, including access roads, a parking area, and different operational zones. The drawing includes a scale of 1:250 and a grid system (A-H, 1-10) for reference. This layout is a clear example of **architectural and civil drafting**, focusing on the functional arrangement and dimensions of a large industrial space.</span>

## #4 - Control Bracket
<span style="font-size: 10px">"This drawing plate, **"Control Bracket"** presents a detailed look at a mechanical part. It includes a 3D isometric view of the bracket and two different orthographic views with extensive **dimensions and annotations**. The drawing specifies details such as hole sizes (ϕ32, ϕ19, ϕ13), chamfers, and radii (R3, R18, R20). This is a classic example of a **3D modeling and technical drawing** exercise, focusing on precision and clarity for manufacturing.</span>

## #5 - Rendered 3D Bedroom
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Titled **"Rendering 3D Bedroom"** is a photorealistic visualization of a bedroom interior. It shows a bed, nightstands, and a large window, all illuminated by both artificial and natural light sources. The drawing demonstrates skills in **3D rendering**, **lighting**, and **material application** to create a lifelike representation of an architectural design.</span>

## #6 - Mechanical Assembly Drawing
<span style="font-size: 10px">"This plate, **"Mechanical Assembly Drawing"** shows a colorful and detailed representation of a gear mechanism. It features an exploded isometric view on the right, showing how the individual parts—gears, pulleys, and shafts—fit together. Orthographic views are also included on the left, providing additional perspectives. The use of color helps to distinguish the different components. This drawing is a great example of a **CAD assembly project**, illustrating how multiple parts combine to form a functional whole.</span>
